# Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable "skills" and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code or Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

If you have the upstream (obra) superpowers plugin installed, **uninstall it first** — both plugins use the same `superpowers` name and will conflict:

```bash
# 1. Remove existing superpowers plugin (if installed)
/plugin uninstall superpowers

# 2. Remove obra's marketplace (if registered)
/plugin marketplace remove superpowers-marketplace

# 3. Restart Claude Code to apply removals
/exit
```

Then in a fresh session, add the GoCodeAlone marketplace and install:

```bash
# 4. Register the GoCodeAlone marketplace
/plugin marketplace add GoCodeAlone/superpowers-marketplace

# 5. Install the plugin
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

```text
/plugin-add superpowers
```

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoCodeAlone/claude-superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoCodeAlone/claude-superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Verify Installation

Start a new session in your chosen platform and ask for something that should trigger a skill (for example, "help me plan this feature" or "let's debug this issue"). The agent should automatically invoke the relevant superpowers skill.

## Cross-LLM Compatibility

Superpowers skills run on any host that supports the SKILL.md format. Host-specific tools (like Agent Teams) are conditioned with `<host: claude-code>` blocks so other hosts skip them gracefully.

| Host | Install path | Native skill discovery | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplace/superpowers/` | yes | Full Agent Teams support (experimental flag) |
| Codex | `~/.agents/skills/superpowers/` | yes | Sequential sub-agent dispatch; `/plan` slash; `/agent` switching |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/superpowers/` | yes | Tool mapping documented in `.opencode/INSTALL.md` |
| Cursor | `/plugin-add superpowers` | yes (via plugin) | Plugin manifest defines skills/agents/commands/hooks |

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, lists load-bearing assumptions, runs a self-challenge round, presents design in sections for validation. Soft cap of 5 question-batches; on exceed, agent presents best-current-approximation and asks user to approve / refine / extend the budget. Saves design document.

2. **adversarial-design-review (design phase)** - Activates after design doc is committed. Adversarially attacks the *ideas* in the design (not just structure): unstated assumptions, repo-precedent conflicts, YAGNI violations, missing failure modes, security gaps, rollback story, simpler alternatives, user-intent drift. PASS/FAIL with max 2 revision cycles.

3. **recording-decisions** - Activates inside brainstorming and writing-plans whenever a non-trivial choice is made (divergence from precedent, trade-off between ≥2 plausible approaches, adversarial-review override, cross-skill structural change). Adds a numbered ADR in `decisions/` so the *why* survives renames and refactors.

4. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

5. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps. Runtime-affecting tasks include rollback notes. Plan MUST contain a `## Scope Manifest` block declaring PR Count, Tasks, Out-of-scope items, and a per-PR grouping table — this is the contract `scope-lock` enforces.

6. **adversarial-design-review (plan phase)** - Activates after plan doc is committed. Inherits the design checklist plus plan-specific scans: task granularity, verification-class match, hidden serial dependencies, rollback wiring.

7. **alignment-check** - Activates after adversarial review of plan passes. Narrowly structural: every design requirement maps to a plan task; every plan task traces to a design requirement; the Scope Manifest is well-formed (forward + reverse + manifest trace via `tests/plan-scope-check.sh`).

8. **scope-lock** - Activates immediately after `alignment-check` PASS. Stamps the plan with `Locked <timestamp>`, computes the manifest's sha256 into `<plan>.scope-lock`, commits both. From this point until completion (or an explicit user-approved unlock), the task list, PR count, and feature scope are immutable. `subagent-driven-development` re-checks the lock between tasks; `finishing-a-development-branch` re-checks before any PR is created.

9. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with a locked plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality). Between tasks, re-runs the scope-lock check; on lock drift, stops the line and surfaces the discrepancy.

10. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

11. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

12. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Step 1d (Scope Completeness Check) verifies every manifest task has implementing commits and that the autonomous run produces the planned number of PRs (no silent collapse). Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

13. **pr-monitoring** - Activates after autonomous PR creation (one monitor per PR in the manifest). Watches CI and review comments; fixes failures and responds to feedback until green.

14. **post-merge-retrospective** - Activates after `pr-monitoring` exits successfully on a merged PR with green CI. Reads the design, plan, adversarial-review reports, code-review threads, and CI history; produces a short retro in `docs/retros/` scoring each adversarial finding (Prescient / Resolved upfront / False positive / Inconclusive), naming gate misses, and surfacing plugin-level follow-ups when patterns emerge across retros.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Auditing skill activations

`tests/skill-activation-audit.sh` reads `.claude/superpowers-state/in-progress.jsonl` (the activity log written by the `record-activity` hook) and reports which pipeline gates fired during a session. Use it post-hoc when you want to confirm whether the autonomous pipeline ran end-to-end or stopped earlier than expected. Strictly local — never transmits anything.

`tests/skill-cross-refs.sh` verifies that cross-skill references inside `skills/` and `agents/` markdown resolve (skill names, `Step N` references, `superpowers:<name>` mentions). Run it before committing any skill edit that renames a skill or renumbers a step.

`tests/plan-scope-check.sh` verifies the Scope Manifest invariant. Three modes: `--plan <path>` (well-formedness — PR Count matches the grouping table; every task in the body appears in the table; etc.), `--verify-lock <path>` (manifest sha256 matches the `.scope-lock` file written at alignment time), and `--against-branch <plan>` (planned branches in the manifest exist locally or on origin). The autonomous pipeline runs all three at the appropriate gates; CI can run `--plan` against every plan in `docs/plans/`.

## Strict-interpretation invariant

Once a plan is locked, ambiguous user phrases — "reorder as needed", "create a PR", "test locally", "ship a demo", "be quick" — do NOT authorize rescoping, PR collapse, or partial-scope shipping. The agent picks the most-faithful-to-the-locked-manifest interpretation; if multiple strict readings remain plausible, it stops and asks. See the table in `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` § "Strict-interpretation invariant" for the full mapping and the unlock path.
