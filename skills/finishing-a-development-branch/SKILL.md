# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## Autonomous Mode

When running in the autonomous pipeline (invoked from subagent-driven-development in autonomous mode):

1. **Verify tests pass** — same as manual mode, abort if failing
2. **Run Step 1d (Scope Completeness Check)** — see below. This is a mandatory gate in autonomous mode. The agent MUST NOT silently collapse N planned PRs into 1, nor declare success on a partial scope. If Step 1d surfaces a failure, the autonomous pipeline halts and asks the user.
3. **Skip option presentation** — go directly to PR creation
4. **For every PR row in the manifest's PR Grouping table, create one PR.** The manifest is the contract. If the table has 3 rows, the autonomous run produces 3 PRs, each pointing at the branch named in the row. Do NOT collapse rows — collapsing is the exact failure mode `skills/scope-lock/SKILL.md` defends against. Per-PR steps:
   ```bash
   feature_branch="<feature-branch>"
   feature_name="<feature-name>"

   # Validate that branch and feature names contain only safe characters
   case "$feature_branch" in
     (*[!A-Za-z0-9._/-]*|'')
       echo "Error: invalid feature branch name: $feature_branch" >&2
       exit 1
       ;;
   esac

   case "$feature_name" in
     (*[!A-Za-z0-9 ._/-]*|'')
       echo "Error: invalid feature name: $feature_name" >&2
       exit 1
       ;;
   esac

   git push -u origin "$feature_branch"
   gh pr create --title "$feature_name" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

5. **Invoke pr-monitoring** — spawn a single background monitor that covers all PRs created in this session
6. **Report PR URLs** — output every PR link for the user (one per row in the manifest's PR Grouping table)

**Do NOT:**
- Present the 4-option menu in autonomous mode
- Ask for user confirmation
- Wait for user input

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 1b.

### Step 1b: Runtime Launch Validation (conditional)

**Trigger:** the diff includes any of:

- Build configuration (Dockerfile, build script, CI build steps)
- Deployment configuration (compose, Kubernetes manifests, deployment workflows)
- Version pins on runtime, libraries, or build/launch-affecting tooling (images, CI build tools, language runtimes) — excludes dev-only tooling such as linters and formatters
- Application-startup configuration (config files read at boot)
- Database migrations
- Plugin / extension loading paths

If triggered: invoke `skills/runtime-launch-validation/SKILL.md`. Build and launch the artifact under production-equivalent conditions, run the failure-signature scrape, capture the transcript, paste it into the PR body.

If NOT triggered (pure logic refactor, doc-only, test-only): skip this step.

**The launch transcript is required in the PR body when this step triggers.** Without it, the PR is not ready for merge — even if all unit tests pass.

### Step 1c: Version-Skew Audit (conditional)

**Trigger:** the diff updates a non-dev-only version pin (any "version: vX.Y.Z", "image: foo:vX.Y.Z", or `<package>@vX.Y.Z`) — excludes dev-only tooling pins (linters, formatters) where skew is generally benign.

Action:

1. Grep the repo for related pins (other versions of the same component, sibling tooling, components in the same release group).
2. For each related pin, compare lag.
3. If lag is >2 minor versions, flag in PR body:
   ```
   Version skew detected: pinned ToolingA@v1.2.0 while related EngineA@v1.6.0
   (4 minor versions ahead). Compatibility verified via: <link or note>.
   ```
4. Resolve before merging — bump the lagging pin, OR state explicitly why the skew is intentional and safe.

If NOT triggered: skip this step and continue to Step 1d.

### Step 1d: Scope Completeness Check (mandatory)

**Trigger:** always. This step is the gate that prevents the agent from declaring victory on a partial-scope solution.

Action:

1. Identify the plan: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`. If there is no plan in `docs/plans/` for this branch (manual/ad-hoc work), skip this step.
2. Run `bash tests/plan-scope-check.sh --plan <plan-path> --verify-lock <plan-path>`. The script verifies the manifest is well-formed and the locked hash still matches.
3. **For every `### Task N:` heading in the plan body**, verify that a commit on the feature branch implements that task. Use the task's `**Files:**` block (`Create:` / `Modify:` / `Test:`) to map files to the task; `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD -- <file>` should show at least one commit per task.
4. **Compute the actual PR count** for autonomous mode: count distinct branches in the manifest's PR Grouping `Branch` column that have commits ahead of base. This must equal `**PR Count:**` in the manifest.

**On any failure of Step 1d:**

- **Missing tasks:** stop. Do NOT create any PR. Report exactly which task(s) have no implementing commits, and ask the user one of:
  > Tasks <list> have no implementing commits on this branch. Options:
  > 1. Implement the missing tasks (preferred).
  > 2. Approve a scope reduction — I will invoke `recording-decisions` to write an ADR removing those tasks from the manifest, then re-run `alignment-check` against the reduced design+plan.
  > 3. Abort the PR creation; keep the branch as-is for inspection.
  >
  > Which option?
- **PR count mismatch (autonomous mode):** if the manifest expects N PRs but the branch layout produced fewer, the agent must split the branch via `git rebase --onto` per the manifest's grouping table — NOT collapse the manifest. Collapsing N planned PRs into 1 is exactly the failure mode `scope-lock` exists to prevent.
- **Locked-hash mismatch:** the manifest has been edited after the lock. Surface the diff and stop. The user must either revert the edit or go through the unlock path (`recording-decisions` + re-run alignment-check).

Do not proceed past Step 1d on any failure without explicit user direction. There is no "demo mode" — see the anti-patterns in `skills/scope-lock/SKILL.md`.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# If tests pass
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1, 2, 4:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** (Step 7) - After all tasks complete
- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete

**Calls (autonomous mode):**
- **superpowers:pr-monitoring** - After PR creation, monitors CI and reviews

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
